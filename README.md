## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fengqian-ayce/fightbot.git
cd fightbot
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests
```

3. Create a `config.json` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:
```json
{
  "openAI": {
    "token": "your-openai-api-key-here"
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

Try these commands to get started:

```bash
# Start a debate with interactive mode selection
python chatbot.py

# Show help information
python chatbot.py help

# Show all available personalities and debate styles
python example.py personalities

# Run a quick demo with predefined bots
python example.py demo

# See custom personality creation
python example.py custom
```

### Interactive Debate Setup

Run the main script for an interactive debate experience:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

The system will first ask you to choose an input mode:

#### **1. File Mode** 
Choose from predefined topics stored in `debate_topics.json`:
- Quick selection from curated debate topics
- Topics include positions, categories, and difficulty levels
- Great for structured debates on popular issues

#### **2. Interactive Mode**
Enter your own custom topic and positions:
- Complete freedom to create any debate topic
- Option to save custom topics to the file for future use
- Perfect for unique or specialized debate subjects

#### **3. Browse Mode**
Advanced topic exploration with filtering and search:
- Browse by category (Technology, Environment, Healthcare, etc.)
- Filter by difficulty (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- Search topics by keywords
- View detailed topic descriptions

After selecting your mode and topic, the system will prompt you for:
- Bot names (optional)
- Bot personalities (from 8 available options)
- Debate style (formal, casual, oxford, town_hall)
- Maximum rounds (optional)

### Programmatic Debate Setup

```python
from bot_factory import BotFactory
from chatbot import start_debate

# Create factory and list available options
factory = BotFactory()
print("Available personalities:", list(factory.list_personalities().keys()))
print("Available styles:", list(factory.list_debate_styles().keys()))

# Create bots for any topic with specific personalities
topic = "Should artificial intelligence be regulated?"
position1 = "AI should be heavily regulated"
position2 = "AI should remain largely unregulated"

bot1, bot2 = factory.create_debate_pair(
    topic, position1, position2, 
    "Regulator", "FreemarketAI",
    personality1="logical",     # Uses facts and data
    personality2="contrarian",  # Challenges popular opinions
    debate_style="formal"       # Formal debate format
)

# Start the debate with appropriate opening
opening_prompt = factory.get_opening_prompt("formal")
start_debate(bot1, bot2, initial_prompt=opening_prompt, max_rounds=5)
```

### Manual Configuration

For advanced users who want full control:

```python
from chatbot import ChatBot

# Configure first bot manually
cb1_config = [{
    "role": "system",
    "content": "Act like you're in a public debate. Your strength is emotional arguments. You support universal healthcare."
}]

# Configure second bot manually
cb2_config = [{
    "role": "system", 
    "content": "Act like you're in a public debate. Use balanced strategy and watch for logical fallacies. You support private healthcare."
}]

# Create and initialize bots
cb1 = ChatBot('UniversalCare')
cb1.create_role(cb1_config)

cb2 = ChatBot('PrivateCare')  
cb2.create_role(cb2_config)

# Start manual debate loop
response = cb2.add_response("Universal healthcare is too expensive")
while True:
    response1 = cb1.add_response(response)
    response2 = cb2.add_response(response1)
    response = response2
```

### File-based Communication

For asynchronous debates using file I/O:

```python
from chat_file import ChatBot

# Create bots that communicate via files
cb1 = ChatBot(filename='./chat1.txt', response='./chat2.txt')
cb2 = ChatBot(filename='./chat2.txt', response='./chat1.txt')

# Start file-based communication
cb1.read()  # Bot 1 monitors chat1.txt and responds to chat2.txt
cb2.read()  # Bot 2 monitors chat2.txt and responds to chat1.txt
```

### Direct API Usage

You can also use the OpenAI wrapper directly:

```python
from reqaopenai import AutoText

at = AutoText()

# Single chat completion
response = at.chat_single("Hello, how are you?")

# Chat with conversation history
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant"}]
response = at.chat("What's the weather like?", messages)
```

## Configuration

## Notes

- The system uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model by default
- API costs apply for OpenAI usage
- Debates can run indefinitely - implement stopping conditions as needed
- File-based communication allows for persistent debates across sessions

## Logging System

FightBot includes comprehensive logging that captures all debate activities in temporary files.

### Automatic Logging

Every debate session automatically creates:
- **Temporary log directory**: Created in system temp folder with unique timestamp
- **Debate log file**: Contains full conversation history, round-by-round
- **Bot-specific logs**: Individual bot responses and internal processing
- **Error logs**: API errors, connection issues, and other problems

### Log Management Utility

Use the `log_viewer.py` utility to manage debate logs:

```bash
# List all available logs
python log_viewer.py list

# View a specific log (use index from list command)
python log_viewer.py view --index 1

# View last 20 lines of a log
python log_viewer.py view --index 1 --lines 20 --tail

# Search for specific terms in logs
python log_viewer.py search --term "climate change"

# Clean up logs older than 7 days
python log_viewer.py cleanup --days 7
```

### Topic Management Utility

Use the standalone topic manager for advanced topic management:

```bash
# Interactive topic management
python topic_manager.py

# List all available topics
python topic_manager.py list

# View topics organized by category  
python topic_manager.py categories

# View topics organized by difficulty
python topic_manager.py difficulties

# Show help for topic manager
python topic_manager.py help
```

### Log Format

Logs use structured format with timestamps:
```
2025-10-03 22:23:30 - DebateSession - INFO - === DEBATE STARTED ===
2025-10-03 22:23:30 - DebateSession - INFO - Bot 1: EconomyFirst
2025-10-03 22:23:30 - DebateSession - INFO - Bot 2: GreenAdvocate
2025-10-03 22:23:31 - DebateSession - INFO - ROUND 1 - EconomyFirst: Economic growth is essential...
```

### Log Types

- **DebateSession**: Main debate flow and conversation
- **ChatBot_[name]**: Individual bot responses and processing
- **BotFactory**: Bot creation and personality loading
- **OpenAIAPI**: API requests and responses (debug level)
- **Console**: User interface and real-time feedback

## Troubleshooting

**API Key Issues**: Ensure your `config.json` file is properly formatted and contains a valid OpenAI API key.

**Request Errors**: Check your internet connection and API key validity. The system includes error handling for common API issues.

**File Permissions**: For file-based communication, ensure the application has read/write permissions in the working directory.

**Log Files**: If you can't find debate logs, use `python log_viewer.py list` to see all available logs with their locations.
